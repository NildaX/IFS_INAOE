PURPOSE:
 
        Provides a 2D interactive visualisation of the spaxels and spectra of a
        3D cube.
 
  EXPLANATION:
        For install the package of prueba_ifsUW:
		pip install prueba_ifsUW
		
		For show the window of prueba_ifsUW, en cualquier terminal of python run the next
		code:
		
		from prueba_ifsUW import *
		x = prueba_ifsUW()
		
		The program accept FITS files with extensions:
		.fits
		.fits.gz
		
		The fits files should have projection of RA and DEC
		or grades
		
		
		
        The program displays one windows: 
		on the right top have the files explorer, two panels to show the name of the object
		and the state of the explorer (on, off, select a pixel for the center of the integrated region and show the integrated spectrum),
		one panel to show messsages of the program like the dimensions of the cube, filters used, instruccions, errors, etc.,
		next label at the right content the functions to the integrated region, entry for the radius, buttons for create files
		when previusly draw circle and show the integrated spectrum of the spaxels inside the cirle:
		
		   Extracted FITS:         NAMEFITS_rscube_circle_centerx_centery.fits
           Integrated ASCII:       NAMEFITS.spectrum_centerx_centery.txt
           Espectrum FITS:         NAMEFITS.spectrum_centerx_centery.fits
        Hacia abajo show the options to display axis in projections in RA-DEC and offsets.
		Hacia abajo the functions for mark wavelength in the format of numbers separaters by a coma
		example: 400,500
        the values should be minimun value of the array lambda <= x <= maxinum value of the array lambda
		next label at the right content the functions to display Color map for the image FITS
		next label at the right content the functions to display Filter map for the image FITS
		
		
		Several options are available to better visualise the data, including
        the central wavelength and type of narrow/broad band image, different
        color map and the display ranges in the spectral window.
